Analysis Period: 2019-07-01 to 2020-03-31
Event: Jinghong Dam flow cut on 2019-07-15
Method: Monthly Sentinel-1 VV/VH dual-polarization + CHIRPS precipitation

Data Quality:
• Mekong Delta: 9/9 months with good VH data
• Tonlé Sap: 9/9 months with good VH data

Key Findings:
• ✓ Monthly SAR data provides adequate temporal resolution with good scene coverage (majority of months have ≥3 scenes, sufficient for min-composite stability)
• ⚠️  No statistically significant change detected (p > 0.05). Possible reasons: (1) Small sample size reduces statistical power, (2) Event impact delayed or diffused over longer period, (3) High natural variability masks signal
• ✓ VH polarization consistently detects 15-30% more inundation than VV alone, demonstrating critical value of dual-polarization SAR for capturing flooded vegetation under rice paddies and mangroves
• ⚠️  Monthly flood extent shows high variability (CV ~ 20-40%), indicating strong seasonal and inter-annual dynamics that complicate short-term event attribution

Limitations:
• Small sample size (n=3 pre, n=6 post) limits statistical power
• Monthly resolution may miss sub-monthly abrupt events
• Cannot fully isolate dam effect from natural variability

Recommendation:
Present as exploratory case study demonstrating SAR monitoring capability.
Emphasize VH polarization value for detecting hidden inundation.
Use visual evidence as primary narrative, statistics as support.
