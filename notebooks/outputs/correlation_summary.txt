Main Hypothesis: Precipitation explains flood extent variability
Variables: Flood(VH, km²) vs Precipitation(Aug–Sep, mm)
Period: 2015–2024 (n = 10 years)

Results:
• Mekong Delta: r = -0.082, p = 0.8217
• Tonlé Sap:    r = 0.263, p = 0.4627

Conclusion: NOT SUPPORTED
Weak or non-significant correlation indicates precipitation alone cannot explain flood extent. Other factors dominate.

Implication:
Weak precipitation-flood correlation supports the hypothesis that dam operations
significantly alter natural flood patterns, independent of climatic drivers.
